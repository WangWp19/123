1. list A = [0,1,2]

     a) listA.append(3)
     b)  listA.remove(1)

2. [0] * 10 this will create a list with ten elements
3. [[]] * 10  this will create a list of empty list
4. tupleA = (1,3), tupleB = (4,4) tupleA + tuple B , concatenate it ,create a new one
5.  The aliasing exist in list.
6.  ** Full sllice, such as listZ = listX[:], Just copy the full elements, not copy the reference **
7.  not a list as a key.
8.  look up by "key"
9.  list = [0,1,2], if 1 not in list
10.  to access value by key
     
**Recursion**

1. always start by a simple version.
